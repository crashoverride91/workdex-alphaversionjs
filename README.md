## Dashboard and tools 

The user dashboard is a composite layout of five "modules" (divs) that each host a tool.

## Vision
The app is created to facilitate the working life of people who use agile work from own home.
This first version is a starting point of what the app will actually be in its full functional efficiency.



## Next level
The next step is to switch to a beta version with user memory data. I will form a development team for the actual implementation of the web app. The language I will focus on will be php with Laravel support.
Most likely, we will open another shared repository for the beta.
